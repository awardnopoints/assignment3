Project to turn lights on and off

This program will ultimately be able to read a set of inputs from a file or a URL and, if the input is in the correct format, it will be able to:
a) render an abstract version of that grid
b) perform all the on/off/switch commands that the inputs request to that grid
c) return the number of lights currently turned on from that grid
