Project to turn lights on and off

This program can read a set of inputs from a file or a URL and, if the input is in the correct format, it can:

a) render an abstract version of that grid

b) perform all the on/off/switch commands that the inputs request to that grid

c) return the number of lights currently turned on from that grid

To install:

pip install git+ https://github.com/awardnopoints/assignment3@alternate

To run after installing:

ledCheck (URL or file location)

NOTE: This version works differently to the master version, in that it works from the bottom up through the commands.
